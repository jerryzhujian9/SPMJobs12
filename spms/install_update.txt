best to keep one minor version for each major version of spm

Note that if you download a full version of SPM (through the web form),
these updates will already have been incorporated in the spm*.zip archive.

so maybe always download the full package, which is easier.

to detect whether there is an update, run spm_update.m
===========================================================
just unpack the update archive over your SPM installation so that newer files overwrite existing files. (merge folders)

The command line syntax to install the updates on Unix systems (Linux, Mac) is:
unzip spm*.zip
unzip -o spm*_updates_rxxxx.zip -d spm*
