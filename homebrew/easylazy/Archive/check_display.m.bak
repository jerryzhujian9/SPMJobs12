    % spm_image is an interactive facility that allows orthogonal sections
    % from an image volume to be displayed.  Clicking the cursor on either
    % of the three images moves the point around which the orthogonal
    % sections are viewed.  The co-ordinates of the cursor are shown both
    % in voxel co-ordinates and millimeters within some fixed framework.
    % The intensity at that point in the image (sampled using the current
    % interpolation scheme) is also given. The position of the crosshairs
    % can also be moved by specifying the co-ordinates in millimeters to
    % which they should be moved.  Clicking on the horizontal bar above
    % these boxes will move the cursor back to the origin  (analogous to
    % setting the crosshair position (in mm) to [0 0 0]).
    %
    % The images can be re-oriented by entering appropriate translations,
    % rotations and zooms into the panel on the left.  The transformations
    % can then be saved by hitting the "Reorient images..." button.  The
    % transformations that were applied to the image are saved to the header
    % information of the selected images.  The transformations are considered
    % to be relative to any existing transformations that may be stored.
    % Note that the order that the transformations are applied in is the
    % same as in spm_matrix.m.
    %
    % The ``Reset...'' button next to it is for setting the orientation of
    % images back to transverse.  It retains the current voxel sizes,
    % but sets the origin of the images to be the centre of the volumes
    % and all rotations back to zero.
    %
    % The right panel shows miscellaneous information about the image.
    % This includes:
    %   Dimensions - the x, y and z dimensions of the image.
    %   Datatype   - the computer representation of each voxel.
    %   Intensity  - scalefactors and possibly a DC offset.
    %   Miscellaneous other information about the image.
    %   Vox size   - the distance (in mm) between the centres of
    %                neighbouring voxels.
    %   Origin     - the voxel at the origin of the co-ordinate system
    %   Dir Cos    - Direction cosines.  This is a widely used
    %                representation of the orientation of an image.
    %
    % There are also a few options for different resampling modes, zooms
    % etc.  You can also flip between voxel space or world space.  If you
    % are re-orienting the images, make sure that world space is specified.
    % Blobs (from activation studies) can be superimposed on the images and 
    % the intensity windowing can also be changed.
